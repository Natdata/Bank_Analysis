Bank Loan Data Analysis

Bank has a loan department - they supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are.

Using Python and Tableau, they’d like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.

Python Scrypt including:

- Data pre-proccesing
- Column populating function
